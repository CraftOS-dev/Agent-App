/**
 * PocketBase launcher (SYSTEM-OWNED — hash-locked in the ownership canon).
 *
 * `manifest.pipeline.start` is `node pb-serve.mjs`; this is the entry point the
 * framework's `serve` AND `dev` spawn. One launcher, one code path, three
 * redirected inputs from the launch contract:
 *
 *   PORT            the port to bind (`serve` passes manifest.port; `dev` a
 *                   hidden one). Falls back to manifest.port when run by hand.
 *   A2APP_DATA_DIR  the data directory (`serve` passes pb/pb_data; `dev` a
 *                   fresh per-boot directory). Defaults to pb/pb_data.
 *   A2APP_ENV       "live" or "dev". Defaults to "live".
 *
 * Environment semantics — "live loads code at boot":
 *   live  hooks are pinned (--hooksWatch=false) and the static View is served
 *         from a SNAPSHOT of pb/pb_public taken at this boot (.a2app/public).
 *         PocketBase serves static files from disk per request, so without the
 *         snapshot a mid-iteration edit to the View would reach live users on
 *         their next refresh — before any gate or verify has seen it.
 *   dev   the tree itself is served: pb/pb_public directly (edit → refresh)
 *         and hooks under watch (auto-restart on edit where the OS supports
 *         it; PocketBase documents no effect on Windows — re-run `dev` there).
 *
 * A superuser is ensured in the target data directory BEFORE serving, from the
 * project-local `.superuser` credential (minted on first use, mode 0600,
 * gitignored). Without one, PocketBase prints an unauthenticated admin-installer
 * URL and pops the setup page — on every fresh dev database, and on the live
 * first serve. Failure to ensure it refuses to serve rather than serving an
 * installable admin takeover.
 *
 * `node pb-serve.mjs --migrate` is the toolkit's `lifecycle.promote`: it applies
 * pending migrations to the data directory and exits. The output is WATCHED,
 * not trusted: PocketBase's `migrate up` can exit 0 on failure and wedge
 * silently on a panic, so a panic line fails the run and a hard timeout bounds
 * it.
 *
 * Why a launcher rather than raw commands in the manifest: `serve` spawns the
 * start command through the OS shell, and `pb/pocketbase serve --http
 * 127.0.0.1:${PORT}` is not portable across shells (cmd.exe expands neither
 * `${PORT}` nor `/`-separated executables). Node resolves both.
