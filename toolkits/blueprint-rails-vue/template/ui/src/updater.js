 * Bridge to the update watcher (AGENT-OWNED; the watcher itself is

 *
 * It is a RUNTIME import — the file exists only on the running server, so the
 * `@vite-ignore` comment keeps the bundler from trying to resolve it at build
 * time. Loading it starts the watch: a CODE change reloads when the page holds
 * nothing unsaved (else offers a banner); a DATA change dispatches
 * `a2app:datachange` on window, which App.vue listens for. Keep this bridge
 * when you rewrite the View — without it, already-open tabs go stale forever.
