# Blueprint reference — react-node

A React (Vite) View + a Hono server + a SQLite store, with the A2App adapter
mounted as embedded `@a2app/adapter-core` middleware.

Where the `creator`/`modify` skill says "per your stack", the answer is here. If
this file and the source disagree, the source wins.

## Read this first

The scaffold gives you a complete, runnable starter app — the A2App adapter, a
working data model, and a full React View — which you edit into your own:

- **entities** — the data model in `a2app.schema.mjs` (see **Schema** below);
- **custom operations** — declared in `schema.operations` + `operations.json` and
  implemented in `schema.operationRunners` (see **Operations**);
- **the View** — the React app in `index.html` + `src/`, built on the shipped
  shared components and design tokens (see **The View**).

The starter models a to-do list; replace it with your own entities, operations,
and screens.

## File map — who owns what

Every file that ships on a fresh scaffold, in the order you meet them:

| Path | Owner | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `a2app.schema.mjs` | **YOURS** | the data model + operations: exports `schema = { entities, operations, operationRunners }`, each entity carrying `module`/`summary`/`fields`/`seed`. Edit this to evolve the app; `describe`/`schemaVersion` derive from it. |
| `operations.json` | **YOURS** | the operation declarations `describe` and approval read (name, module, typed params, entity, appliesWhen, flags). Byte-mirror of `schema.operations`. |
| `index.html` | **YOURS** | the Vite entry: links `tokens.css`/`ui.css`, mounts `#root`, loads `src/main.jsx`. |
| `src/main.jsx` | **YOURS** | React root: StrictMode + ToastProvider + App; imports `updater.js` to start the update watcher. |
| `src/App.jsx` | **YOURS** | the View logic: state machine (loading/ready/error), add/advance/delete actions, filters, the `a2app:datachange` listener, boot. |
| `src/api.js` | **YOURS** | the one fetch wrapper — 10 s timeout, GET retry-once, readable error messages. |
| `src/Icon.jsx` · `src/toast.jsx` · `src/ConfirmDialog.jsx` · `src/format.js` | **YOURS** | the shared pieces — icon set, `useToast`, `useConfirm` (in-app dialog, never `window.confirm`), day formatting. One impl each; compose, never re-implement. |
| `src/updater.js` | **YOURS** | the runtime bridge to the system-owned update watcher. Keep it when you rewrite the View. |
| `public/tokens.css` | **YOURS** | design tokens (the kit sheet): foundation `--agent-app-*` + semantic bridge, light + dark + style packs. Re-point values; keep the NAMES stable. |
| `public/ui.css` | **YOURS** | component styles (buttons, cards, list rows, dialog, toasts). Consumes semantic tokens only. |
| `vite.config.js` | **YOURS** | the View build: React plugin, `dist/` output, dev-server proxy to the running app. |
| `AGENT_APP.md` | **YOURS** | this app's index: plan, modules, entities, operations, conventions, checklist. |
| `reference/requirements.md` | **YOURS** | the binding spec — Part A (SRS) + Part B (tech spec + Quality Conformance). |
| `reference/tasks.md` | **YOURS** | the build ledger — one task per feature/quality item, ticked as you complete it. |
| `reference/blueprint.md` | reference | this file — the stack map. |
| `.gitignore` | **YOURS** | ignores `data/`, `dist/`, credentials, and framework state. Extend for your own artifacts. |
| `package.json` | build | dependencies (react, hono, better-sqlite3, adapter-core) + scripts (`build` = vite build, `dev:ui` = vite dev server). Referenced by the pipeline. |
| `manifest.json` | SYSTEM (hash-locked) | app identity, `modules[]`, `authMode`, `pipeline` (install/build/start/health). Change modules via the CLI, never by hand-editing a locked field. |
| `server.mjs` | SYSTEM (hash-locked) | the Hono server + `@a2app/adapter-core` middleware + the SQLite binding: serves the records API, identity, describe, the built View (`dist/`), and `/_a2app/update.js`. Never edit. |
| `a2app-update.js` | SYSTEM (hash-locked) | the update watcher served at `/_a2app/update.js` — detects code vs. data staleness in an open tab. Never edit. |
| `scripts/dev-prepare.mjs` | lifecycle | run by `agent-app dev`: builds a fresh, seeded SQLite store in an isolated dir. Leave it alone. |
| `scripts/promote-apply.mjs` | lifecycle | run by `agent-app promote`: applies to live after a mandatory backup. Leave it alone. |
| `dist/` | build output | the compiled View (`npm run build`). Git-ignored; served by `server.mjs`. Never edit by hand. |
| `data/` | runtime | the live SQLite database (git-ignored, created on first boot). Never edit by hand; never commit. |

SYSTEM files are hashed in `.a2app/system-hashes.json`; the gate fails the build
if one changes. Need a variant of a shared component? Wrap it in `src/`, never
edit the locked original.

## Mental model

- The **adapter is the only agent surface.** A human uses the View; an agent
  operates the same records through A2App. Both converge on the SQLite store.
- **`a2app.schema.mjs` is the single source of truth for the model.** You never
  hand-write `describe` — the adapter derives it (and `schemaVersion`) from your
  schema. Change the schema, and every A2App screen updates.
- **The store is schema-derived and additive.** Records are JSON rows in one
  SQLite table keyed (entity, id); there are no migration files on this stack.
  Add a field to the schema and it is simply available; existing rows keep
  their stored values. This is the opposite of the pocketbase stack — do not go
  looking for a `migrations/` directory.
- **The View is served BUILT.** `vite build` compiles `index.html` + `src/`
  into `dist/`; `server.mjs` serves `dist/` with real cache validators. A
  source edit does nothing until the next build.

## Schema — entities & fields

Edit `a2app.schema.mjs`. It exports one object:

```js
export const schema = {
  entities: {
    <entity>: {
      module: "<module-from-manifest>",   // REQUIRED — every entity names its module
      summary: "one line shown beside it on the module screen",
      fields: [
        { name: "title", type: "string", required: true, max: 200 },
        { name: "status", type: "enum", values: ["todo", "doing", "done"] },
        { name: "due", type: "string", max: 10, dayKey: true },  // "YYYY-MM-DD"
        { name: "created", type: "datetime", readOnly: true },   // server-set
      ],
      seed: [ { id: "…", title: "…", created: "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" } ],
    },
  },
  operations: [ /* see below */ ],
  operationRunners: { /* see below */ },
};
```

**Field types** (the A2App protocol vocabulary): `string` · `number` ·
`boolean` · `datetime` · `enum` (+ `values`) · `ref` (+ `entity`) · `list<enum>`
· `list<ref>` · `json` · `binary`. Field flags: `required`, `readOnly`
(server-managed, agents may not write it), `max`, and `dayKey: true` for a
whole-day text field advertised as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Seeding:** `entities.<name>.seed` is applied when the store is built fresh
(first boot, `dev`, and after `promote`). Seeded data survives; test data you add
at runtime does not carry to a fresh DB.

## Operations — anything beyond plain CRUD

Plain create/read/update/delete needs no operation — the records API covers it.
A declared operation is required only for behavior beyond that. Declare it in
**two places that must agree**, then implement it:

1. `schema.operations` (in `a2app.schema.mjs`) — and the identical row in
   `operations.json`.
2. `schema.operationRunners` — the implementation.

```js
operations: [
  { name: "clear-done", description: "Delete every done task.",
    destructive: true, module: "planning", params: {} },
  { name: "complete-task", description: "Mark one task done.",
    module: "planning", entity: "tasks",
    appliesWhen: { field: "status", ne: "done" },
    params: { task: { type: "ref", entity: "tasks", required: true } } },
],
operationRunners: {
  "clear-done": (_args, _ctx, { store }) => {
    let removed = 0;
    for (const rec of store.list("tasks")) {
      if (rec.status === "done" && store.remove("tasks", rec.id)) removed++;
    }
    return { removed };
  },
  "complete-task": (args, _ctx, { store }) => {
    const task = store.get("tasks", args?.task);
    /* … */
    store.put("tasks", task);
    return { ok: true };
  },
},
```

- **Runner signature:** `(args, ctx, { store }) => jsonableResult`. `store` is
  the SQLite-backed record store — `list(entity)` · `get(entity, id)` ·
  `put(entity, record)` · `remove(entity, id)`. Writes are durable when the
  call returns; there is no separate persist() step.
- **`params` is REQUIRED and typed** (same vocabulary as fields); use `{}` for
  none. The record screen renders it as the signature — args described only in
  prose can neither be shown nor checked.
- **`entity`** attaches the op to a record screen; **`appliesWhen`** decides
  availability on a given record and the adapter derives the blocked reason from
  it. Comparisons only — `eq`, `ne`, `in`, `notIn`, `isBlank`, composed with
  `all`/`any`/`not`. Never a natural-language rule.
- **Flags:** `destructive: true` (requires human approval), `readOnly: true`
  (no side effects), `idempotent: true` (safe to repeat).
- The gate step **"operations resolve"** fails the build if any declared
  operation has no runner function.

## The View — `index.html` + `src/`

A React SPA over the same records API the agent uses. Same-origin writes are
trusted by the adapter, so the browser needs no token.

**Records API** the View calls (PocketBase-compatible REST, served by the adapter):

| Call | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/collections/<entity>/records?sort=-created&page=1&perPage=100&filter=status = "todo"` | list; returns `{ items, totalItems }` |
| `POST /api/collections/<entity>/records` (JSON body) | create; returns the stored record |
| `PATCH /api/collections/<entity>/records/<id>` | update |
| `DELETE /api/collections/<entity>/records/<id>` | delete |
| `GET /api/_a2app` | identity (app name, versions) |

Always render back what the server **stored**, not what you sent. Never render an
unbounded collection — page with `perPage`.

**Shared pieces — `src/`** (one implementation each; import, don't rebuild):
`<Icon name size>` · `useToast()` → `toast(kind, message)` ·
`useConfirm()` → `[confirm, confirmElement]` (in-app dialog — never
`window.confirm`) · `api(path, init)` · `fmtDay(dayKey)` · `isPastDay(dayKey)`.
Component styles are plain CSS classes in `public/ui.css`.

**Tokens — `public/tokens.css`:** the kit sheet — `--agent-app-*` foundation →
semantic bridge. Components consume ONLY semantic tokens (`--bg-surface`,
`--text-primary`, `--accent-solid`, `--danger-solid`, `--focus-ring`, `--sp-*`,
`--r-*`, `--fs-*`, `--dur-*`, …). Theme by re-pointing the foundation or picking
a `[data-style]` pack; keep the names stable. Light and dark both resolve every
token and hold WCAG AA. Never hardcode a value where a token exists.

**Realtime / staleness — `src/updater.js`** bridges to the system-owned
watcher (`/_a2app/update.js`, a RUNTIME import the bundler must leave alone).
It reloads the tab on a CODE change when nothing is unsaved, and on a DATA
change (an agent wrote through A2App) dispatches `a2app:datachange` on `window`
so the View re-reads without discarding a half-typed form. Keep the bridge and
the listener when you rewrite the View. Do not add your own polling or reload
logic.

**Building:** `npm run build` (the pipeline build step) compiles the View into
`dist/`. For tight iteration `npm run dev:ui` runs Vite's dev server with
`/api` and `/_a2app` proxied to the running app — start the app first
(`agent-app <dir> serve` or `dev`).

## External data (third-party APIs)

Call the internet from the **backend only** — never the frontend (CORS breaks,
keys leak). On this stack the backend seam you own is the **operation runner**:
runners execute in-process on the Node server and can `fetch()`. Put third-party
calls (and any secret-bearing request) in a runner, expose the result as records
or an operation return. `server.mjs` is system-owned, so boot-time fetches are
not your seam — model an initial sync as a runner (e.g. a `refresh` operation)
that fills the store when it is empty.

## App→agent triggers

**This blueprint ships no trigger manifest in v0.1.** The creator skill's
"App→agent triggers" section does not apply here — there is no declared-trigger
surface to fire against. Handle app events with plain code. If a feature
genuinely needs the agent to react, say so in `requirements.md` as a known
limitation rather than inventing an unsupported mechanism.

## Build, run, gate

`manifest.json`'s `pipeline` drives everything (`install` → `build` → `start`,
health at `/api/_a2app`). Never start a server by hand.

```bash
agent-app <dir> dev        # boot the candidate on a hidden port: fresh seeded store, prints the dev URL
agent-app <dir> validate   # framework files → build (vite) → schema loads → operations resolve → ownership canon → describe budget (on dev)
agent-app <dir> serve      # launch LIVE as a managed, health-polled background process; prints the URL
agent-app <dir> promote    # requires the gate pass; backup, scripts/promote-apply.mjs, destroys the dev instance
```

Toolkit gate steps (from `a2app.toolkit.json`): **"schema loads (fresh,
additive)"** and **"operations resolve"**. `lifecycle.dataDir` is `data/`.

**Environments (one tree, redirected inputs).** `server.mjs` reads `PORT`,
`A2APP_DATA_DIR` and `A2APP_ENV` from the framework. The dev instance runs
against a disposable per-boot SQLite store and serves `dist/` directly — a
View edit needs a rebuild to show; a `server.mjs`/schema edit needs `dev`
again. The LIVE instance serves a boot-time snapshot of `dist/`
(`.a2app/public`), so edits never reach users until promote + serve.

## Footguns for this stack

- **Two files, one truth.** Every operation lives in BOTH `schema.operations`
  and `operations.json`, byte-agreeing on name/module/params/flags. The gate
  fails a mismatch.
- **The View is served built.** Editing `src/` changes nothing a browser sees
  until `npm run build` runs. If the app looks stale, check `dist/` before
  debugging the server.
- **No migrations here.** Schema is declarative and additive; do not look for or
  create a `migrations/` directory.
- **Empty-DB first paint.** A fresh app has no records — the View must render its
  loading/empty/error states without erroring. The verifier fails any first-paint
  error.
- **Keep the update-watcher bridge.** Rewriting the View without `src/updater.js`
  (the runtime import of `/_a2app/update.js`) leaves already-open tabs stale
  forever.
